For a long time, people thought Expo was only for small apps or beginner developers. But that paradigm is now outdated: limitations have become the exception, not the rule.

💡 Even though Expo Core provides powerful and mature tools—like the brand new Expo Router v5, which I find particularly impressive—sometimes you need access to platform-specific native features: iOS widgets, system sensors, advanced audio modules…

🧩 That’s exactly what I experienced a year ago, when integrating an iOS widget into an app for a client.
At the time, I discovered you can avoid “ejecting” the project!

👉 Thanks to the Expo Modules API, I was able to create a local native module in Swift, cleanly integrated into an Expo project with the Dev Client. The result: I kept all the benefits of the Expo workflow (cross-platform, EAS Build, top-notch DX) while accessing full native power.

📜 A bit of history:
The Expo Modules API was introduced in July 2021 with Expo SDK 42. With the stable release of EAS Build in 2022, the framework took a major turn: this API lets you write native code via Dev Client without ejecting—which used to be the only option for custom native code.

⚠️ The classic fear (“Expo can’t do X”) almost always means today:
→ “It requires a dev build or a plugin,”
→ not “it’s impossible.”

**In summary:**

- Expo RN devs have every reason to collaborate with native devs—or become hybrid themselves.
- You can stay in the Expo ecosystem while unlocking native capabilities, with unified code for shared logic and platform-specific code when needed.
