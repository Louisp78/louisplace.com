title: 'SDUI Pattern for Mobile Apps'
summary: 'Discover how the Server-Driven UI (SDUI) pattern empowers mobile teams to update app interfaces instantly, without redeployment or app store delays. SDUI lets the backend define UI structure dynamically, enabling rapid A/B testing, personalized modules, and agile product changes—making it a powerful solution for dynamic sections and fast iteration in mobile development.'

During my current internship, I discovered a super powerful pattern: **SDUI** — _Server-Driven UI_.

The idea?

👉 **The backend controls the interface**: it sends a structure (often in JSON) that the frontend interprets to dynamically display the right components.

🎯 **Why is it useful?**

- No need to redeploy the app to change the UI ✅
- In a mobile context, product teams can make **instant adjustments** without waiting for store validation cycles 📱
- Perfect for creating **dynamic sections**, like a home screen with modules personalized for the user
- Enables **large-scale A/B testing** (like Spotify, Meta, Amazon…)

⏳ This way, you bypass long mobile deployment procedures while keeping very fine control over the user experience. Coupled with a classic architecture, such a pattern solves most problems with dynamic sections.

🔥 In a mobile context where every update costs time, **SDUI offers valuable agility**.

Do you use this pattern in your apps? I’m curious to hear your feedback on its implementation on the frontend or backend!
